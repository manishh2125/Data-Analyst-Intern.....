                               CONDITIONAL FORMATTING : FOR COLOR GRADING THE VALUES TO IDENTIFY ANY INCONSISTENCY THEN REMOVING THEM
                               RENAMED THE COLUMNS IN PROPER FORMAT AND ALSO PERFORMED SOME SORTING AND FILTERING TO CHECK DATA 
                               PERFORMED SOME ARITHMETIC FUNCTIONS TO CHECK IF THE DATA IS IN CONSIDERED TYPE OR NOT
